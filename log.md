# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 25th April 2022

First day of the 100daysofcode and the schoolofcode bootcamp 12. Very excited for the bootcamp!

Number 1 realisation was that there is much more to a software developer, full-stack developer, software engineer than coding. 

Technical knowledge: CSS selectors and CSS Flex box.

### Day 2: Tuesday 26th April 2022

Break down the problem! Most of software devlopment isnt about the code, its about understanding the problem.

Used HTML and CSS to create a Koala bear. Bonus task: added CSS animation. Realised too late that the postioning of the elements was dependent on our screen size. Improvements for the future to make it adjustable to all screen sizes and look the same on all devices.

Much better understanding of Git and Github. The basics of the Git prcoedure: add, commit, push, pull is well understood. Bonus task of creating a branch, adding a commit to the branch and merging was successfully completed.

Happy with progress.
