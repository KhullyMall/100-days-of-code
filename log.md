# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 25th April 2022

First day of the 100daysofcode and the schoolofcode bootcamp 12. Very excited for the bootcamp!

Number 1 realisation was that there is much more to a software developer, full-stack developer, software engineer than coding. 

Technical knowledge: CSS selectors and CSS Flex box.
